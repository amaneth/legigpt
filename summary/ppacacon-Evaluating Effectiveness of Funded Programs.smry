1. Based on the two provided document excerpts, the following funding-related information can be extracted:

1. **Document 1:**
   - The Secretary of Health and Human Services is tasked with conducting an evaluation of existing Federal health and wellness programs. While the document itself doesn't mention specific funding amounts or sources, it implies that federal funding has been allocated for health and wellness initiatives that are subject to evaluation based on their effectiveness.
   - The programs evaluated seem to relate to the overall health status of the American public and more specifically the Federal workforce. The mention of the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program suggests that funding may be involved in this aspect as incentives could be funded to encourage healthier choices.
   - The requirement for a report to Congress concerning the evaluation of these programs hints at the accountability and oversight that might impact future funding decisions based on the success or failure of these initiatives.

2. **Document 2:**
   - The Secretary is required to prioritize the evaluation of programs funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) over privately funded programs.
   - This indicates that there is a level of government funding (through the CDC) going into health programs that is significant enough to warrant prioritization for evaluation compared to privately funded programs.
   - The mention that privately funded programs can request an evaluation suggests that the government (i.e., the Secretary's office or associated departments) may allocate resources to evaluate such programs, which might involve some funding or reallocation of existing funding.

**Summary:**
Federal health and wellness programs, including those related to the Federal workforce and the American public, receive funding that is subject to evaluations to validate effectiveness. Funds are allocated through entities like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and possibly through programs incentivized under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. The excerpts do not contain detailed financial information, but they do imply that funding strategies are contingent on the outcomes of program evaluations, and that there is an institutional preference for assessing publicly funded programs over private ones unless specifically requested.
2. Based on the provided documents, here is a summary of funding-related information that can be valuable for funding analysis and predictions:

1. **Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (Document 1)**
   - **Establishment:** A nonprofit corporation known as the 'Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute' is to be established, which is neither an agency nor an establishment of the United States Government.
   - **Funding:** For fiscal year 2010 and each subsequent fiscal year, amounts in the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) under section 9511 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are available, without further appropriation, to the Institute to support its operations.
   - **Activities:** The Institute will assist in making informed health decisions by advancing evidence concerning disease treatment, management, and prevention through research and evidence synthesis considering patient subpopulations.
   - **Contracting:** Contracts for the management of funding and conduct of research will be given preference to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes of Health when the research conducted is authorized by their governing statutes.
   - **Data Collection:** The Secretary shall provide the Institute with data collected under Medicare, Medicaid, and related programs as required to carry out the section's activities.

2. **Research on Optimizing the Delivery of Public Health Services (Document 2)**
   - **Funding:** The Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Director of the CDC, shall provide funding for research in public health services and systems.
   - **Research Areas:** This includes examining evidence-based prevention practices, analyzing the translation of interventions from academic to real-world settings, and identifying effective strategies for organizing, financing, or delivering public health services.

3. **Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research (Document 3)**
   - **Termination:** The document notes the termination of the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research established under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

4. **Developing Methodology to Assess Health Plan Value (Document 4)**
   - **Development and Consultation:** The Secretary of Health and Human Services is expected to develop a methodology in consultation with stakeholders to measure health plan value, considering factors like cost, care quality, efficiency, risk, and the actuarial value of the benefits.
   - **Report:** A report is to be submitted to Congress within 18 months after the enactment detailing the developed methodology.

For funding analysis and predictions, one should note the active roles of federal agencies in dispensing funds for comparative clinical effectiveness research, improvements in public health service delivery, the established methodology for health plan value assessment, and the cessation of specific previous programs like the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research. These insights can inform future funding availability, areas of research emphasis, and the approaches taken by government agencies and stakeholders in healthcare and public health services.
