1. From the provided documents, here are the key funding-related information extracted for analysis and predictions:

**Document 1 (Research on Optimizing the Delivery of Public Health Services):**
- The document does not provide specific funding amounts but indicates that the Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide funding for research in the area of public health services and systems.

**Document 2 (Prevention and Public Health Fund):**
- Specific appropriations to the Prevention and Public Health Fund are outlined as follows:
  - Fiscal Year 2010: $500,000,000
  - Fiscal Year 2011: $750,000,000
  - Fiscal Year 2012: $1,000,000,000
  - Fiscal Year 2013: $1,250,000,000
  - Fiscal Year 2014: $1,500,000,000
  - Fiscal Year 2015 and each fiscal year thereafter: $2,000,000,000

- Funds from the Prevention and Public Health Fund are to be used to increase funding over the fiscal year 2008 level for programs authorized by the Public Health Service Act. The use includes prevention, wellness, and public health activities such as prevention research, health screenings, initiatives like the Community Transformation grant program, Education and Outreach Campaign Regarding Preventive Benefits, and immunization programs.

- There is provision for transfer of funds subject to the discretion of the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to the uses laid out in subsection (c).

**Summary for Analysis & Predictions:**
- The specific funding levels are set for fiscal years 2010 through 2015 and beyond, indicating an increasing trend in budget allocation for the Prevention and Public Health Fund.
- There are targets for enhancing existing prevention, wellness, and public health initiatives with these funding provisions.
- Due to the legislation's statutory nature, future predictions can include an at-least baseline funding of $2,000,000,000 annually for fiscal year 2015 and onward, assuming no legislative changes.
- Analyses over time should track actual fund disbursement, usage, and potential supplemental appropriations or amendments to the funding levels.
- For the non-specified funding in Document 1, the actual amounts might be subject to annual federal budget processes and priorities. It would be important to track yearly budget proposals and allocations for more accurate predictions regarding funding for research into optimizing the delivery of public health services.
